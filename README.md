# Streamy

## Overview

**Streamy** is an AI Powered Proxy Streaming Server.<br>
This System Support Multiples Ways:
* Content Aware Video Encoding (Video Conferencing Oriented)
* Speech Enhancement
* Speech To Text Translation.<br>

**NOTE:** This System Is Still Under Development and there are not any release yet.

## Installation

## Content Aware Video Encoding (CAE)
The main idea is to remove unnecessary high frequencies from the less important area of 
the frames. we got the main idea from [1].

### Selfie Segmentation Based CAE
In this system we've used [MediaPipe Selfie Segmentation ](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/selfie_segmentation.html) as **ROI Detection Algorithm**.

### Motion Based CAE
In this system MOG2 Background subtraction [2] as a **ROI Detection Algorithm** However, 
this method is considered less effective and efficient in 
normal condition because it is required a very stable camera
,so in the future, we aim to use a **Free Moving Camera Background Subtraction Algorithm**.


## Speech Enhancement
For **Speech Enhancement** of stream we've implement three different methods



### Thresholding Based Audio Denoiser
In this system we apply a fuzzy thresholding on signal components in time-frequency domain

### Noise PSD Estimation Based Audio Denoiser
In this system used modified implementation of the algorithm proposed in [3] with **Wiener Filter**

### DEMUCS Based Speech Enhancement
In this system we've used the model proposed in [4]. and adapt the hole code of this
system from his [official implementation](https://github.com/facebookresearch/denoiser)

## Speech To Text Translation
